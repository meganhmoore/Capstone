#Capstone Project

This capstone project conducted research on existing censorship devices being used around the world.
It used a physical device to fingerprint and identify it on a network, and used Zmap and Zgrab from the University of Michigan to conduct internet scans
of the public IPv4 address space to locate the devices.

Additionally, research into the type of content being filtered was conducted to determine the intention for using the devices.
